This project is the part of a Front-end Nanodegree programme by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

The project is about to have a _Landing Page_ using _HTML_, _CSS_, & _JavaScript_. The requirement for this project is that when user clicks on the **nav** links it should jump on the particular section of that link and the links should be populated using _JavaScript_ and also highlight that section using _JavaScript_.
